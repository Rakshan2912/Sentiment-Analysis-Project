Sentiment Analysis Project
Overview
This project is a Sentiment Analysis application developed to classify text data as positive, negative, or neutral. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the model can analyze and determine the sentiment behind text inputs. This project is ideal for analyzing customer feedback on an dataset containing opinionated text.

Project Structure
Notebook: FINAL_PROJECT_NLP.ipynb - Contains all the code and analysis for the project, including data processing, model training, and evaluation.
Data: Dataset used for training and testing the model (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g2G_xqbSPiYsvXufDQ0tTjzwqyaoXcQT/view?usp=sharing).
Models: Machine learning models used for classification (details provided in the notebook).
Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Loading and cleaning the data.
Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization).
Feature extraction using methods like TF-IDF or Word Embeddings.
Model Training:

Selection of machine learning models for sentiment classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random forest classifier).
Training and tuning the model on the processed data.
Evaluation:

Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Visualization of sentiment distribution and model performance metrics.
Deployment :

If applicable, deployment steps or instructions for integrating the model into applications.
Key Features
Sentiment Classification: Automatically classifies text data into positive, negative, or neutral categories.
Customizable Pipeline: Easily adaptable for different datasets or additional classification categories.
Interactive Notebook: Contains step-by-step explanations, making it easy to follow and understand each part of the process.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
Libraries:
Pandas, Numpy - For data manipulation.
NLTK - For NLP processing.
Scikit-Learn - For machine learning models.
Matplotlib - For data visualization.

How to Run
Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
Install the necessary dependencies using:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the notebook FINAL_PROJECT_NLP.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset and run each cell to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate results.
Results
The model achieves [accuracy:0.999555 ,precision: 1, recall: 1, F1-score: 1] on the test dataset. The results are visualized and explained in the notebook, providing insights into the distribution of sentiments and model effectiveness.
